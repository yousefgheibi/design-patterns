## Facade Design Pattern

### **Intent:**

Provide a simplified, unified interface to a complex system of classes. The Facade pattern reduces dependencies and improves usability by encapsulating a group of subsystems behind a single interface.

### **Problem**

- Complex systems often have multiple interdependent classes that make them difficult to use and maintain.
- Direct interaction with all components increases coupling and reduces flexibility.
- Need a way to simplify interactions with a subsystem while keeping the implementation details hidden.

### **Solution**

The Facade pattern introduces a **single entry point** (a facade class) that encapsulates and simplifies interactions with multiple underlying components. The facade delegates client requests to appropriate subsystem classes.

### **Implementation Steps**

1. **Identify Subsystems**
   - Determine the set of classes that form the complex system.
   
2. **Create Subsystem Classes**
   - Implement individual components that handle specific functionality.

3. **Implement the Facade Class**
   - Create a class (`Facade`) that provides a simplified API.
   - This class holds references to subsystem components and delegates calls.

4. **Use the Facade**
   - Instead of calling subsystems directly, the client interacts with the `Facade`, which internally calls the necessary components.

### **Benefits of Facade Pattern**

- **Reduces Complexity:** Provides a simple API to interact with a complex system.
- **Encapsulation:** Hides implementation details of subsystem components.
- **Loosely Coupled Code:** Reduces direct dependencies on internal components.
- **Improves Maintainability:** Changes to subsystem classes do not affect the client code using the facade.
