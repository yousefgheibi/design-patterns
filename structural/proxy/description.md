## Proxy Design Pattern

### **Intent:**

Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access, add additional functionality, or defer expensive operations.

### **Problem**

- Some objects are resource-intensive and should not be created or accessed repeatedly.
- Unrestricted access to certain objects might lead to security or performance issues.
- There may be a need to introduce additional behaviors like logging, caching, or access control without modifying the original object.

### **Solution**

The Proxy pattern suggests introducing a **proxy class** that implements the same interface as the original service object. The proxy controls access to the real object and can add extra functionality, such as:

- **Lazy initialization**: Creating the object only when it's actually needed.
- **Access control**: Restricting unauthorized access.
- **Caching**: Storing results for repeated requests.
- **Logging and monitoring**: Keeping track of requests made to the service.

### **Implementation Steps**

1. **Define a Common Interface**

   - Create an interface that both the real service and the proxy class will implement.

2. **Implement the Real Service Class**

   - This class contains the actual business logic and operations.

3. **Create the Proxy Class**

   - Maintain a reference to the real object.
   - Implement additional behaviors like caching, security, or logging.
   - Forward requests to the real service when necessary.

4. **Use the Proxy Instead of the Real Service**
   - The client interacts with the proxy instead of directly accessing the real service.
   - The proxy manages object instantiation and lifecycle.

### **Benefits of Proxy Pattern**

- **Improves Performance:** Lazy initialization and caching reduce unnecessary computations.
- **Enhances Security:** Access control mechanisms can prevent unauthorized use.
- **Encapsulates Additional Behavior:** Allows adding features without modifying the original class.
- **Supports Remote Access:** A proxy can represent objects located on remote servers.

### **Example Use Cases**

- **Database Access:** Implementing a proxy to delay expensive queries until they are needed.
- **API Requests:** Caching responses to reduce redundant API calls.
- **Security Proxies:** Restricting access to sensitive resources.
- **Virtual Proxies:** Deferring the creation of large objects until required.

### **Comparison with Other Patterns**

- **Adapter:** Translates one interface into another, while a Proxy keeps the same interface but controls access.
- **Decorator:** Adds functionality dynamically, whereas a Proxy may enforce control.
- **Facade:** Simplifies an interface, while a Proxy manages access to an object.
