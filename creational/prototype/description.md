# Prototype Design Pattern

## Intent
Prototype is a creational design pattern that allows copying existing objects without making the code dependent on their concrete classes.

---

## Problem
- Need to create an exact copy of an object.
- Direct copying may not work due to private fields.
- Dependency on concrete classes should be avoided.
- Object construction is expensive or complex.

---

## Solution
The Prototype pattern delegates the cloning process to the actual objects being cloned. It introduces a common interface with a `clone()` method that allows objects to copy themselves. This approach:
- Avoids dependencies on specific classes.
- Ensures private fields are copied correctly.
- Enables object duplication without knowing the exact type.

---

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Define a Prototype Interface
The interface declares a cloning method, typically named `clone()`.

### 2. Implement Concrete Prototypes
Each concrete class implements the cloning method, ensuring that all relevant fields are copied.

### 3. Use the Prototype in Client Code
Instead of creating new objects using constructors, the client clones existing objects using the `clone()` method.

### 4. Optional: Implement a Prototype Registry
A registry can store pre-configured prototypes and provide cloned instances when needed.

## Example Usage
Use the Prototype pattern when:
- You need to create object copies without depending on concrete classes.
- Object construction is costly or complex.
- You want to avoid subclassing for minor variations.
