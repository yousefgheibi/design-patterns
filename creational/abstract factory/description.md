# Abstract Factory Design Pattern

**Intent**:  
Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

---

## Problem
- Need to create multiple related objects without specifying their exact classes.
- Want to ensure that objects created together are compatible.
- Need to adhere to the Open-Closed Principle, allowing easy extension without modifying existing code.

## Solution
The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related objects. It ensures that the created objects are used together while promoting loose coupling.

---

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Define Abstract Product Interfaces
Create interfaces or abstract classes for each type of object the factory will create.

### 2. Implement Concrete Products
Provide concrete implementations of the abstract product interfaces.

### 3. Define an Abstract Factory Interface
Define an interface for creating families of related objects.

### 4. Implement Concrete Factories
Each concrete factory implements the abstract factory interface and returns specific product variants.

### 5. Use the Factory in Client Code
The client uses the abstract factory interface to create objects without depending on specific implementations.

## Example Usage
Using the Abstract Factory pattern allows the client code to work with abstract types, ensuring flexibility and scalability in object creation.
